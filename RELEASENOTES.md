- __BREAKING CHANGE:__ Require the AWS region to always be specified with the `--aws-region` argument or `AWS_REGION` environment variable if using AWS S3 for blob storage. Previously, this was optional (with a warning) if you weren't specifying an AWS session token.
- __BREAKING CHANGE:__ Drop support for deprecated `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in `gh gei` and `gh bbs2gh`. The AWS S3 credentials can now only be configured using the industry-standard `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables or command line arguments.
- __BREAKING CHANGE__: Require the Bitbucket Server URL, project key and repo to always be provided for `bbs2gh migrate-repo`, even if using the upload-and-migrate (`--archive-path`) or migrate-only (`--archive-url`) flows
- Increase timeouts in archive uploads to AWS to prevent timeouts during large uploads
