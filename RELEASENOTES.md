- __BREAKING CHANGE__: Require the Bitbucket Server URL, project key and repo to always be provided for `bbs2gh migrate-repo`, even if using the upload-and-migrate (`--archive-path`) or migrate-only (`--archive-url`) flows
- Drop support for deprecated `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY` environment variables in `gh gei` and `gh bbs2gh`. The AWS S3 credentials can now be configured using the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables or command line arguments.
- Increase timeouts in archive uploads to AWS to prevent timeouts during large uploads
